# n8n-nodes-extended-globalprompts

This package provides a simple node that reads prompts from credentials so they can be reused across different workflows. It ships with an additional Example node demonstrating how to structure extended nodes.

To publish it as a community node, create an npm package and [submit it to the npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry).

## Prerequisites

You need the following installed on your development machine:

* [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Node.js and pnpm. Minimum version Node 20. You can find instructions on how to install both using nvm (Node Version Manager) for Linux, Mac, and WSL [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). For Windows users, refer to Microsoft's guide to [Install NodeJS on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows).
* Install n8n with:
  ```
  npm install n8n -g
  ```
* Recommended: follow n8n's guide to [set up your development environment](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/creating-nodes/build/node-development-environment/).


## Installation

Install the package from npm:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-extended-globalprompts
```

## Example node


The repository ships with a small Example node located in `/nodes/Example`. It simply returns a greeting for the provided name. You can optionally enable a **Reverse** option to return the greeting backwards. Use this node as a starting point for building your own extended nodes.
